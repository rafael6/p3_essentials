To store and exchange data 
It is readable but not as concise as YAML
Python support JSON nitavely via json library 
Serialization: (encoding, writing to disk) the process of transforming data into bytes to be stored or transmited 
Deserialization: (decoding/reading into memory) the process of decoding JSON data that has been stored or delivered

SERIALISATION:
Turning Python to JSON objects

Methods:
  dump() for writing data to file
  dumps() for reading to a string

Python / JSON:
  dict / object
  list, tuple / array
  str / string
  int, long, float / number
  True / true
  False / false
  None / null

JSON example:
data = {
    "people": { 
        "name": "Rafael",
        "species": '"Human
    }
}

Create a file with context manager, <write_file> is the file-like object
with open ("data_file.json", "w") as write_file:
    json.dump(data, write_file)

Create native Python str, no file-like object since we are not writting to disk
json_string = json.dumps(data)

Nested/Indentation:
json_string = json.dumps(data, indent=4)

Separators:
Default = json_string = json.dumps(data, separators (", ", ": "))
Compact = json_string = json.dumps(data, separators (",", ":"))

DESERIALIZATION:
Turning JSON into Python objects
JSON / Python:
  object / dict
  array / list
  string / str
  number (int) / int
  number (real) / float
  true / True
  false / False
  null / None

Methods:
  load() from file
  loads() from string

Read a file with context manager, <read_file> is the file-like object
with open ("data_file.json", "r") as read_file:
    json.load(data, read_file)

JSON from Python string:
  data = json.loads(json_string)
